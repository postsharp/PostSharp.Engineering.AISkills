# Check TeamCity Build Status

Check the status of a TeamCity build.

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS - Format: `<buildId> [mode]`
- `buildId`: Required. The TeamCity build ID (e.g., 310921)
- `mode`: Optional. `once` (default) or `continuous`

## Examples

- `/tc-check-build 310921` - Check once
- `/tc-check-build 310921 continuous` - Monitor until completion

## Instructions

1. Get the build ID from arguments (required)
2. Query TeamCity API for build status
3. Based on mode:
   - **once**: Report status once and exit
   - **continuous**: Check every 30 seconds until build completes, report errors immediately

## Prerequisites

Verify `$TEAMCITY_CLOUD_TOKEN` is set before making API calls. If not set, ask the user to configure it.

## TeamCity API

**Server:** https://postsharp.teamcity.com
**Endpoint:** GET `/app/rest/builds/id:<buildId>`
**Auth:** Bearer token from `$TEAMCITY_CLOUD_TOKEN`

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEAMCITY_CLOUD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  https://postsharp.teamcity.com/app/rest/builds/id:<buildId>
```

## Response Fields

- `state`: queued, running, finished
- `status`: SUCCESS, FAILURE, UNKNOWN
- `statusText`: Human-readable status
- `percentageComplete`: Progress percentage (when running)
- `webUrl`: Link to build in TeamCity

## Continuous Mode

When in continuous mode:
1. Check status every 30 seconds using Bash with `sleep 30`
2. Report progress updates (percentage, status changes)
3. If build fails, report the failure details and stop
4. If build succeeds, report success and stop
